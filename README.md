# Programming Languages and their Correlational Frameworks and technologies.

# Introduction 

While constructing data, we spend a lot of time and energy thinking how tech ecosystem works and how programming languages and their frameworks are related to each other. One way to get at this idea of relationship between technologies is Correlation. We constructed a graph about the programming languages of the last 40 years and their correlative frameworks or technologies. Through this, we can get how technologies are connected and also how many frameworks does one language has and how are used together. Developers can get a helpful of ideas through this information.

# Data Collection

We went through different websites while constructing our data. We collected the information of frameworks by searching each individual language and then taking information about their relative techs and frameworks. 
We crawled through many webs but some of the main source of our data were 

•	Kaggle

•	Wikipedia

•	https://medium.com/web-development-zone/a-complete-list-of-computer-programming-languages-1d8bc5a891f



# Network Graph

Average degree denotes that every language has atleast 2 or more frameworks and every language is connected to two or more technologies. The 147 nodes indicates the languages and the 159 edges relate to their relation and framework.
